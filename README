## FarmRPG Truffle Calculator ##

WARNING: While nothing in this script either makes calls to the FarmRPG servers or automates any in-game tasks, the Admins still have the final say as to whether or not scripts of this nature are allowed. As their opinions are subject to change, usage of this plugin comes at your own risk.

A Greasemonkey user script designed to streamline the process of calculating how many truffles your pigs can produce per day.

This script takes unfed and slaughterhouse pigs into account, and will specifically avoid considering them in the calculations.

## Installation instructions ##

To download and install this script:
    - Download one of these three extentions, depending on your browser: Greasemonkey [Recommended] (Firefox), Tampermonkey (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), Violentmonkey (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    - Open https://github.com/unamusedcanadian/truffle-calc-farmrpg/blob/main/truffle_calc.user.js in your browser.
    - Confirm the installation popup.

    Disclaimer: This code has only been tested with Greasemonkey. While it should be compatible with Tampermonkey and Violentmonkey, there are no guarantees of functionality on those forks.

To uninstall this script:
    - Open this script in your extention's main ("monkey") menu.
    - Click "Uninstall".

## Technical details and why I created this script ##

Ever since learning that truffles were not a guaranteed drop from pigs, I found myself slightly dissatisfied with the FarmRPG community simply saying you would get the sum of your pig levels divided by the droprate on average each reset.

While it is true that this estimate is the average, it doesn't reflect the full range of possibilities that could occur in one daily reset. I wanted to make a plugin that could calculate a full Binomial Distribution of truffle chances.

However, due to the fact that pig levels can vary within a singular pen, I couldn't just calculate the probabilities through the classical Probability Mass Function, as said function requires *all* trials to have a constant chance.

After some research, I found a wikipedia article that solved my problem. Said page gave me the pseudocode for an algorithm that I could use to accurately calculate the chances of each quantity of truffle type dropping. This plugin is the result.

When you load your pigpen, it automatically scans the HTML of the webpage for the levels of your pigs. This process is fully client-side, meaning that there will be no additional strain on the FarmRPG servers.

The script then performs a Poisson Binomial Distribution algorithm behind the scenes to calulcate the chances, and displays them in a neat little graph alongside some other miscellaneous information.
